# multi-task-learning

Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that involves training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In MTL, instead of training separate models for each task, a single model is trained that can perform all tasks.

The key idea behind MTL is to learn a shared representation that can capture the common features across multiple tasks, while also learning task-specific representations that can capture the unique features of each task.

In MTL, the loss function typically consists of a weighted sum of the losses for each task, where the weights determine the importance of each task.

During training, the model learns to optimize the loss function across all tasks simultaneously.

MTL can be implemented using various techniques, such as hard parameter sharing, where the model shares some of its parameters across all tasks, or soft parameter sharing, where the model learns to adapt its parameters to each task through a regularization term.

Another popular approach is to use a multi-head architecture, where each task has its own output head that is connected to a shared feature extractor.
